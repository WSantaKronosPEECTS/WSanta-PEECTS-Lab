The WSanta-PEECTS-Laboratory is dedicated to advancing predictive science through the **Palindromic Entangled Elastic Crystal Time Strings (PEECTS)** theory. Our mission is to develop transparent, verifiable, and functional models that enhance human safety, disaster preparedness, and scientific understanding.

## üåç Purpose
- Develop and test predictive models using PEECTS theory.
- Validate forecasts against multiple publicly available scientific models (e.g., USGS, NOAA).
- Provide an open, ethical, and verifiable framework for peer collaboration.

## üìä Resources in this Repository
- **DIAGRAMS/**: Visual maps and scientific comparison figures.
- **SUMMARY_PAPER/**: Drafts, papers, glossary, and scientific notes (e.g., PEECTS Dr Santa.txt).
- **CONSOLE (Kronas)**: Integration of Kronas, the AI assistant, for live testing and validation via GitHub Discussions.
- **docs/**: Onboarding guide, glossary, and reference materials.
- **data/**: Sample datasets for PEECTS validations.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for model runs.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive explorations.
- **results/**: Output from model validations and forecasts.

## üõ† Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the repo**:
