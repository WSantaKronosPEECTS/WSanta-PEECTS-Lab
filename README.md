🔎 **Badge meanings**  

The **WSanta-PEECTS-Laboratory** is dedicated to advancing predictive science through the  
**Palindromic Entangled Elastic Crystal Time Strings (PEECTS) theory**.  
Our goal is to provide transparent, verifiable, and functional models that improve human safety,  
disaster preparedness, and scientific understanding.

---

## 🌍 Purpose
- To develop and test predictive models using PEECTS theory.  
- To validate forecasts against multiple **publicly available scientific models**.  
- To offer an open, ethical, and verifiable scientific framework for peer collaboration.

## 🧭 Ethical Code
This laboratory operates on principles of:

1. **Transparency** — all results should be openly verifiable.  
2. **Ethical use** — predictive models must be used for human safety and knowledge,  
   never for exploitation without acknowledgment.  
3. **Non-commercial exploitation** — results should not be monetized without  
   proper credit to the scientific origin.  
4. **Scientific rigor** — methods and outcomes must be tested and corrected  
   against multiple public/global sources.  
5. **Human purpose first** — the guiding principle is reducing risk and  
   advancing knowledge for all.
