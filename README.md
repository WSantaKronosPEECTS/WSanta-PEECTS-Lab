# WSanta‑PEECTS‑Lab

**An open scientific forecasting and modeling lab based on the Palindromic Entangled Elastic Crystal Time Strings (PEECTS) Unification Theory.**  
Developed by Dr. Wilfredo Santa Gómez to refine predictions across multiple fields—hurricanes, gravitational waves, volcanology, solar storms, forensic reconstruction, and beyond.

## 🧬 Overview

**WSanta‑PEECTS‑Lab** is a transdisciplinary digital laboratory applying the **PEECTS framework** to real-world forecasting challenges.  
PEECTS introduces *Elastic Time Corrections (ETC)*, entangled spacetime models, and palindromic dynamics to improve the accuracy and explanatory power of scientific simulations and alerts.

This repository offers tools, models, simulators, and validation workflows for:
- Natural disaster prediction (hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, solar flares)
- Gravitational and quantum event modeling
- Forensic accident reconstruction
- Environmental-economic forecasting
- Dolphin biomechanics and adaptive behavior
- Signal cloud alerts and real-time ETC applications
