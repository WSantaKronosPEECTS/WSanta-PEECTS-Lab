# üìò PEECTS Glossary

This glossary defines key terms, modules, and concepts used across the WSanta-PEECTS Lab. It supports contributors, reviewers, and agencies in understanding the scientific and operational language of the framework.

## üîë Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PEECTS** | Predictive Entanglement Echo Chrono Tracking System; a unified framework for forensic simulation, elastic time modeling, and entanglement-aware auditing |
| **Elastic Time Chain** | A sequence of timestamped events that stretch or compress based on entanglement logic and anomaly detection |
| **FIET** | File Identity Elastic Tracker; detects anomalies and entanglement across file systems and simulation logs |
| **Time Crystals** | Hypothetical structures used in simulation to model periodic entanglement and echo behavior |
| **Audit Lens** | A visualization layer that renders entanglement overlays and validation status for forensic modules |

## üß™ Modules & Tools

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ForensicCar** | Simulation app with embedded video toggles and forensic logic |
| **ElasticMapRenderer** | Renders entanglement overlays and time chain maps |
| **ChronoCrystallo** | Time-based simulation engine for echo validation |
| **AutoAppend** | Script that injects README, LICENSE, and metadata into app folders |
| **Validation Archive** | Folder containing logs, sweep results, and audit-ready outputs |

---

## üß≠ Contributor Metadata

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **README** | Introductory file explaining module purpose and usage |
| **LICENSE** | Legal file defining usage rights and author attribution |
| **Badges** | Visual indicators of validation status, contributor role, and audit readiness |
| **Changelog** | Log of updates, fixes, and version history |

---

## üåê Deployment Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Audit-Ready** | Module has passed FIET sweep, entanglement validation, and metadata injection |
| **Public Release** | Tagged version of the lab ready for external review and agency use |
| **Semantic Tag** | Version label (e.g. `v1.0.0`) indicating stability and readiness
